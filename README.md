# Foot-and-mouth-disease-analysis

The general objective of this project is to determine the genetic characteristics of foot and mouth disease (FMD) viruses in circulation in the last six years (2013-2018) and of current vaccine strains in Kenya.

This is part of the molecular work of a PhD project; mainly sequencing different strains from FMD isolates collected in the past six years with the aim of carrying out phylogenetic analysis. Samples of serotype A and O were processed in the laboratory and cDNA Products were sent to Macrogen, Amsterdam in The Netherlands for sequencing. Analysis and publication preparation is ongoing.

The data used for this analysis was sequenced on a Sanger sequencing platform. Additional data was obtained on NCBI to enrich the phyloegentic tree constructed at the end of this analysis.
