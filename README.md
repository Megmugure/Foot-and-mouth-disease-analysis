# Foot-and-mouth-disease-analysis

The general objective of this project is to determine the genetic characteristics of foot and mouth disease (FMD) viruses in circulation in the last six years (2013-2018) and of current vaccine strains in Kenya

This is part of the molecular work of a PhD project; mainly sequencing different strains from FMD isolates collected in the past six years with the aim of carrying out phylogenetic analysis. Samples of serotype A and O were processed in the laboratory and cDNA Products were sent to Macrogen, Amsterdam in The Netherlands for sequencing. Analysis and publication preparation is ongoing.
